1 Thread the Needle

[Verse 1]
Bury me inside this
Labyrinth bed
We can feel that time is
Dilated

[Chorus]
We can spend the night in
Fascination
You can thread the needle
Time and time again

[Post-Chorus]
You turn the lights down
Come on and find out
You turn the lights down
Come on and find out

[Verse 2]
Something to confide in
Something to erase
Just look at where we're lying
An invisible space

[Chorus]
We can spend the night in
Fascination
You can thread the needle
Time and time again

[Instrumental Break]

[Post-Chorus]
You turn the lights down
Come on and find out
You turn the lights down
Come on and find out

[Instrumental Outro]
2 Fields of Elation 

[Verse 1]
The daylight recedes in unison, this room
Buries the hours, like death in motion

[Chorus]
Nobody else can pull me out
The fields of elation, quiet and loamy

[Verse 2]
Your name is a sin I breathe, like oxygen
Caught in the careless arms of lust again

[Chorus]
Nobody else can pull me out
The fields of elation, quiet and loamy

[Chorus]
And nobody else can pull me out
The fields of elation, quiet and loamy
And nobody else can pull me out
The fields of elation, quiet and loamy

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I'm losing my faith in our lives apart
I'm losing my faith in our lives apart
I'm losing my faith in our lives apart
I'm losing my faith in our lives apart

3 When the Bough Breaks

[Verse 1]
You could stay alive
Just tell me that you notice
Even in the dark
The way I left you breathing

[Refrain]
Sometimes when we touch
Everything we love resets
It's only just enough
Even when we run with death

[Verse 2]
We could be released
Flowing over sorrow days
We could stay suspended
Even when the bough breaks

[Refrain]
Sometimes when we touch
Everything we love resets
It's only just enough
Even when we run with death

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
Don't lie to me

[Chorus]
Everything we touch turns water into blood
(Don't lie to me, don't lie to me)
You try to look away from, even when the bough breaks
(Don't lie to me, don't lie to me)
You don't really love, you just hate to be alone
(Don't lie to me, don't lie to me)
You hate to be alone
(Don't lie to me)
You hate to be alone
(Don't lie to me)
Everything we touch turns water into blood
(Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, don't lie to me)
You try to look away from, even when the bough breaks
(Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, don't lie to me)
You don't really love, you just hate to be alone
(Don't lie to me, don't lie to me, don't lie to me)
You hate to be alone
(Don't lie to me)
You hate to be alone
Everything we touch turns water into blood
You try to look away from, even when the bough breaks
You don't really love, you just hate to be alone
You hate to be alone
You hate to be alone
Everything we touch turns water into blood
(Don't lie to me)
You try to look away from, even when the bough breaks
(Don't lie to me)
You don't really love, you just hate to be alone
(Don't lie to me)
You hate to be alone
(Don't lie)
You hate to be alone

1 Calcutta 

[Verse 1]
I am caught, tangled in
Wrapped and quartered
Tripping up and over
Time lived again
For just a moment
Missing pieces find me

[Pre-Chorus]
I sweat and I ache for
Your eyes and the way you breathe

[Chorus]
And I wake, saying your name
And I wake, saying your name

[Verse 2]
You are more than warm belief
Melting skywards
More than silence broken
I'm whole again
For just a moment
Till the morning comes

[Chorus]
And I wake, saying your name
And I wake, saying your name

[Bridge]
Oh, she said you'd better believe it
I said you don't know
Oh, you said you'd better believe it
I said you don't even know

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Time lived again for just a moment
Missing pieces find me
And I'm whole again for just a moment
Missing pieces find me
Time lived again for just a moment
(I sweat and I ache for)
Missing pieces find me
(I sweat and I ache for)
And I'm whole again, whole again
(I sweat and I ache for)
Whole again
(I sweat and)

2 Nazareth

[Verse 1]
And I'll see you when the wrath comes
Knocking on your bedroom door with money
Building you a kingdom
Drippin' from the open mouth
I'll show you what you look like from the inside
And I'll see you when the wrath comes around

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You have the answer
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You have the answer

[Verse 2]
Let's load the gun
Make her eat the tape in the bathroom mirror
See if she can guess what
A hollow point does to a naked body
Let's fuck her up
Manifest pain at the core of pleasure
I'll see you when the wrath comes around

[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You have the answer
Tonight, tonight, tonight
You have the answer

[Bridge]
Let's load the gun
(They won't be missing you, they won't be missing you)
Let's load the gun
(They won't be missing you, they won't be missing you)
Let's load the gun
(They won't be missing you, they won't be missing you)
Let's load the gun
(See you when the wrath comes, see you when the wrath comes)
(They won't be missing you, they won't be missing you)
Let's load the gun
(See you when the wrath comes)

 
3 Jericho  

[Verse 1]
Tread, ancient water salt
Like I
Sink, down like precious stones (Oh)

[Refrain]
Until I wake I, dine on old encounters
Until

[Chorus]
You taste like new flesh
You taste like new flesh
You taste like new flesh
Say my name again

[Verse 2]
Fold, secrets in the sweat
Like I
Swallow, years beneath this bed (Oh)

[Refrain]
Until I wake I, dine on old encounters
Until (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's something in the way you lay
Enough to make the dead switch graves
You take your leave

[Chorus]
You taste like new flesh
You taste like new flesh
You taste like new flesh
Say my name again
Say my name again

[Bridge]
My hands are not worthy
My hands are not worthy
(Till I wake I, dine on old encounters)
My hands are not worthy
(Till I wake I, dine on old encounters)
My hands are not worthy
(Till I wake I, dine on old encounters)
My hands are not worthy
(Till I wake I, till I wake I)

[Outro]
Till I wake I, dine on old encounters
Till I wake I, dine on old encounters
Till I wake I, dine on old encounters
Till I wake I, till I wake



1 The Night Does Not Belong to God 

[Verse 1]
When you live
By daylight
With angels
At your side
In order now
Bestowed by
The light of
The sunrise

[Pre-Chorus]
And you remember everything
Only till the sun recedes once again

[Chorus]
And the night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven

[Verse 2]
The whites of your eyes
Turn black in the lowlight
In turning divine
We tangle endlessly
Like lovers entwined
I know for the last time
You will not be mine
So give me the night, the night, the night

[Chorus]
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
The night comes down like heaven
(The whites of your eyes)
The night comes down like heaven
(Turn black in the lowlight)
The night comes down like heaven
(In turning divine)
The night comes down like heaven
(We tangle endlessly)




2 The Offering 

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
And you are a garden, entwined with all
You are the silence on sacred shores
You've got diamonds for teeth, my love
So take a bite of me, just once, I want to
Turn the page once again (Oh)
Take a bite

[Verse 2]
This is a given, an offering
In your favour, a sacrifice in your name
But I know you've got a taste
So just take a bite of me
Turn the page once again (Oh)
Give up the game and let me in (Oh)
My arms belong around you (Oh, oh)
So take a bite, I want to know (Oh)
(I want to)

[Outro]
(Take a bite)
Take a bite

3 Levitate 

[Verse 1]
I can lift you up
Your  body is mostly blood
Like  water, a perfect flood
Engulfing me again (Oh)
And I can tell you won't
Remember  my cracking bones
The  trauma we can't regrow
Just as you leave again, no

[Chorus]
Will  you levitate
Up where the angels inhabit?
Will you levitate
Where I won't reach you?

[Verse 2]
And  we imitate
A story of perfect days
A ballad we fabricate
As you forget your words again (Oh)
And is that all you need
To merely pretend to be
Falling in love with me?
Forgetting the agony again (Oh)

[Chorus]
Will you levitate
Up where the angels inhabit?
Will you levitate
Where I won't reach you?
Will you levitate
Up where my love doesn't matter?
Will you levitate
Where I won't reach you?

[Outro]
Will you levitate?
Will you levitate?
Will you levitate?

4 Dark Signs

[Verse 1]
Where I was raised, there was no streetlights
Just pitch black and passing headlights
And where we met‚ there must have been dark signs
Omens in your skies

[Pre-Chorus]
Most days‚ you reach for safety
Remain calm‚ forget that you know me
And when we met, I could see dark signs
Alarm bells in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I miss the man I was
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
The moment we left off
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
And I hate who I have become
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
Every time I wake up
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)

[Verse 2]
And if you saw the marks on my dashboard
The new scars that I didn't ask for
And would you call asking for answers?
Tear my arms off

[Pre-Chorus]
And most days, you reach for safety
Remain calm‚ forget that you know me (Oh-oh)
When we met, I could see dark signs
Alarm bells in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I miss the man I was
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
The moment we left off
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
And I hate who I have become
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
Every time I wake up
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
And I miss the man I was
The moment we left off
And I hate who I have become
Every time I wake up

[Outro]
I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
When we met, I could see dark signs (Oh)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met‚ I could see dark signs (Oh)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met, I could see dark signs (Oh)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met, I could see dark signs (Oh, no)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met, I could see dark signs, no
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met


5 Higher 

[Verse 1]
You say you won't begin again
Capitulate and let me in
'Cause I am a fire and you are dry as bone
You are taking your time
You are killing me slow
And I know we instigate
Go back and forth
Lacerate
'Cause you can remember only when you're alone
I am granting you more than the debt that I owe

[Chorus]
'Cause I look for scarlet and you look for ultraviolet
And we are exhausted by all this pretending
We just can't resist the violence
And you need a melody, I only need the silence
But each time we battle
The blood and the fury takes us a little higher

[Verse 2]
With all that you believe
You still refuse to shelter me
'Cause I am a danger
And you're a long way from home
You are one among many, but you're now on your own
And I hate the way you look
At me when I am not understood
'Cause you can remember only when you're alone
I am granting you more than the debt that I owe

[Bridge]
You won't begin again
You won't begin again
You won't begin again
You won't begin again

[Chorus]
'Cause I look for scarlet and you look for ultraviolet
And we are exhausted by all this pretending
We just can't resist the violence
And you need a melody, I only need the silence
But each time we battle
The blood and the fury takes us a little higher

[Build]
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe

[Breakdown]
The debt that I owe


6 Take Aim 

[Verse 1]
Wait, won't you wait for me?
Don't you bathe in rivers?
Don't you feel alive?
And when I see you waking up
And it sends me shivers
How you love like weapons kill

[Chorus]
So take aim
At me for once
Just take aim
Break me apart

[Verse 2]
Call, won't you call out my name?
Like a curse on this world?
Like a battle cry?
And you make me hate myself
Make me tear my body
Make me yearn for your embrace

[Chorus]
So take aim
At me for once
Just take aim
Break me apart, love
Won't you?

[Outro]
And you know I'll be yours
When the moment is perfect
I will fire and forget till we both lay broken
And you know I'll be yours
Just want to be worth it
I will run like the wind till you follow me again


7 Give 

[Verse 1]
You take the dark and carve me out a home
I picture you when you are all alone
I know how we got here
I know how we got here
I am the shadow, you're a passenger
I am the intake of breath so sharp and I know you better
Just wanna know you better

[Chorus]
If you wanna give
Then give me all that you can give
All your darkest impulses
And if you wanna give me anything, then give
Give in again

[Verse 2]
I'll tear the fibre from the filament
I'll be the limit of your light again
I wanna taste you better
I wanna taste you better
I will be watching for your enemies
To let them know that they contend with me
I wanna know you're out there
I wanna know you're out there

[Chorus]
If you wanna give
Then give me all that you can give
All your darkest impulses and
If you wanna give me anything
Then give, give in again
I just wanna give
Wanna give you all that I can give
All my darkest impulses
And if you wanna give me anything, then give
Give in again

[Bridge]
In this open warfare
I won't fight fair
No, I won't fight fair
And in your waking moments
I will be there
I will be there

[Chorus]
If you wanna give
Then give me all that you can give
All your darkest impulses
And if you wanna give me anything, then give
Give in again
I just wanna give
Wanna give you all that I can give
All my darkest impulses
And if you wanna give me anything, then give
Give in again


8 Gods 

[Verse 1]
I see the gods avert their gaze from me
My fucking form is but a wreck beneath them
And they're always people I can call on
It's all so easy for me

[Chorus]
No more taking chances
No more teeth to bite with
No more smiling faces
I am alone again

[Verse 2]
You wanna talk?
You wanna talk it out?
'Cause the joke's on me and I'm laughing too
You wanna watch me bleed?
'Cause I bleed so well
It's all so easy for me

[Bridge]
(Eternally, eternally)
Do you like the way it feels?
Like fire from the heavens
Carving past the surface into you
And do you like the way it feels?
Like fire from the heavens
Tearing me asunder beside you

[Breakdown]
It's all so easy for me
It's all so easy for me


9 Sugar 

[Verse 1]
And you play a twisted little game
But I know in a way
You need to complicate
Believe that though we never eat
We still know how to feed
We still know how to bleed (Oh)

[Chorus]
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now

[Verse 2]
My arms keep you in the room
Barely let you move
Show me what you do (Oh)
Tonight, we're second-guessed again
Let me wrap the chains
Addicted to the pain

[Chorus]
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now

[Bridge]
Do you wanna see how far it goes?
Do you wanna test me now, my love?
You must be crazy if you think that I will give in so easily
Things we buried low
Comin' to the surface now, my love
You must be crazy if you think that I will give up the game

[Chorus]
(Oh, whoa)
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(Do you wanna see how far it goes?)
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(Do you wanna test me now, my love?)
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(You must be crazy if you think that I will give in so easily)
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(Things we buried low, comin' to the surface now, my love)
(You must be crazy if you think that I will give up the game)



10 Say That You Will

[Verse 1]
Is that a word you said, my love
Or just a gesture in tongues?
Well, I live to guess your sorrow
And you live to empty my lungs

[Pre-Chorus]
And you've got me up in a frenzy again
And I know you're planning to leave in the end

[Chorus]
Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love
And the instinct to kill
Entangle to one
In this light, you are mine
Till the sweat turns to blood
Won't you say that you will
Even if you won't?

[Verse 2]
Oh, is that a glint in your eye?
Is that a blade in your palm?
Well, I am yours tonight
So will you lay in my arms?

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got me up in a frenzy again
I know you're planning to leave in the end

[Chorus]
Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love
And the instinct to kill
Entangle to one
In this light, you are mine
Till the sweat turns to blood
Won't you say that you will
Even if you won't?
Won't you say that you will?
Let the impulse to love
And the instinct to kill
Entangle to one
In this light, you are mine
Till the sweat turns to blood
Won't you say that you will
Even if you won't?

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again
You've got me up in a frenzy again


11 Drag Me Under

[Verse 1]
And I know
The angels tonight are
As lost for words
As I am
To merely
Behold you
As we lie down together

[Chorus]
Drag me under again
Deep into your love (Oh)

[Verse 2]
And I know
The Gods will
Abandon the heavens just to find us
To merely
Behold you
As we lie down together

[Chorus]
Drag me under again
Deep into your love (Oh)

[Verse 3]
Hold me beneath the surface
(And I know the angels tonight are lost for words)
Deep into your love
(As I am to merely behold you as we lie down together)


12 Blood Sport

[Verse 1]
I wanna roll the numbers
I wanna feel my stars align again
Even if the earth breaks like burnt skin
And the heavens just won't open up for me
Would you invite me in again?
Won't you pay for your arrogance?
Won't you show me your weakness?

[Chorus]
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
So let's play

[Post-Chorus]
And somewhere
Somewhere the atoms stopped fusing
I'm still your favourite regret
You're still my weapon of choosing
And out there
Stuck in a quantum pattern
Tangled with what I never said
You say it doesn't matter

[Verse 2]
I wanna be forgiven
I wanna choke up chunks of my own sins
Even if the sky cracks in mourning
And the heavens just won't open up for me
Would you invite me in again?
Let me pay for my arrogance?
Won't you show me your weakness?

[Chorus]
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win

[Post-Chorus]
And somewhere
(I made loving you a blood sport)
Somewhere the atoms stopped fusing
(I made loving you a blood sport)
I'm still your favourite regret
(I made loving you a blood sport)
You're still my weapon of choosing
And out there
(I made loving you a blood sport)
Stuck in a quantum pattern
(I made loving you a blood sport)
Tangled with what I never said
(I made loving you a blood sport)
You say it doesn't matter



13 Shelter (from the room below)

[Verse 1]
When it rains, you don't take shelter
You don't take signs from God
And when you can't swallow your demons, you become starving
Darling, I'm noticing your flaws
They're exactly what I want
Even if you won't believe me
Know it

[Verse 2]
And as you become part of my waking rituals, I can tell
You gather up all of my demons
You become starving
Darling, I'm noticing my flaws
And I'm matching them with yours
Won't you take me where you're going
This time?

[Chorus]
And no matter the cost of rain
I will shelter you all the same
And no matter the cost of rain
I will shelter you all the same

[Verse 3]
And now and then I notice you laughing
Laughing at perfect death
Then you change, suddenly hollow
You become starving
Darling, we must have met before
Though I could not say for sure
If we knew what we were in for

[Chorus]
And no matter the cost of rain
I will shelter you all the same (Oh, whoa)
And no matter the cost of rain
I will shelter you all the same (Yeah, yeah)
And no matter the cost of rain
I will shelter you all the same (No, oh)
And no matter the cost of rain
I will shelter you all the same
14 When the Party’s Over (from the room below) 

[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothing ever stops you leaving

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that


15 I Wanna Dance With Somebody (from the room below)

[Verse 1]
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
When loneliness calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Verse 2]
I fell in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
And when the night falls
My loneliness calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody (Yeah)
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
And oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
And yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Outro]
Somebody, somebody (Yeah)
Somebody, somebody (Yeah)
Somebody, somebody (Yeah)
With somebody who loves me
Somebody, somebody (Yeah)
Somebody, somebody (Yeah)
Somebody, somebody (Yeah)
With somebody who loves me




1 Atlantic 

[Verse 1]
Call me when they bury bodies underwater
It's blue light over murder for me
Crumble like a temple built from future daughters
To wasteland when the oceans recede
Merry in the morning, earn your bitter fodder
It's easier to try not to eat
So flood me like Atlantic, bandage up the trenches
Anything to get me to sleep

[Verse 2]
I woke up surrounded, eyes like frozen planets
Just orbiting the vacuum I am
They talk me through the damage, consequence
And how it's a pain they know they don't understand
Sobbing as they turn to statues at the bedside
I'm trying not to crush into sand
So flood me like Atlantic, weather me to nothing
Wash away the blood on my hands

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Call me when they bury bodies underwater
It's blue light over murder for me
Crumble like a temple built from future daughters
To wasteland when the oceans recede

[Outro]
Don't wake me, don't wake me
Don't wake me up
(Don't you wake me up)
Don't wake me, don't wake me
Don't wake me up


2 Hypnosis

[Verse 1]
Lift, oh, lift me out
Of my own skin
Of all my doubt
Oh, and take
Take from me
Leave nothing left
Take everything

[Verse 2]
Sink, sink your teeth
Split my skin, no
Just make me bleed
Oh, and give
Give me all
All that I want
Just give me all

[Chorus]
You know you hypnotise me, always
You know you hypnotise me, always
You know you hypnotise me, always
You know you hypnotise me, always

[Bridge]
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
And you make it more
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
Than I could ever feel
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
Before
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
And you make it more
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
Than I could ever feel
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
(You know you hypnotise me, always)
Before
And I am almost under

[Instrumental Outro]
3 Mine 

[Verse 1]
I have waited
Paralysed by my own will
Viciously reminding me still
I'm born to believe
And I am certain, no
That you and I are crashing course
Driven by a holy force
I know you can see

[Chorus]
That you will be mine
Yeah, you will be mine

[Verse 2]
We balance fire in the earth we walk
Will never stop me reaching forth
To see you again
With colours over all the wasted years
Eternity will bring you near
I know you can see
I know you can see

[Chorus]
That you will be mine
Yeah, you will be mine
You will be mine
(But don't give)
You will bе mine
(Me time)
You will bе mine
(You will)
You will be mine
(Be)
You will be mine
(Mine)

[Bridge]
Did you not say we were made for each other?
Did you not say we were made for each other?

[Verse 1]
I have waited
Paralysed by my own will
Viciously reminding me still
I'm born to believe
I am certain
That you and I are crashing course
Driven by a holy force
And oh, you can see

[Outro]
(Did you not say)
You will be mine
(We were made)
You will be mine
(For each other?)
You will be mine (Yeah)
You will be mine (Yeah, yeah, no, oh)
(Did you not say we were made for each other?)
(Oh)

4 Like That 

[Verse 1]
Trapped under the surface of your words
There is a new intention
New whispers that once could not be heard
Catching your intention
Wait, talking with razors on your tongue
Just to provoke my combat
New weapons to snap those final strings
Just to watch me fall back

[Chorus]
Do you like that? (Do you like that? No)
Do you like that?
(Do you like that? Do you like that? Do you like that?)

[Verse 2]
Push down into membranes and layers
Creating a slow dissection
I stumble into your tar trap
An addition to your collection

[Chorus]
Do you like that?
(Do you like that? No)
Do you like that?
Do you like that?
Do you like that?
(Do you like that? No)

[Verse 3]
Fall into your eyes like a gravе
(All that is inside, all your anger)
Bury me to thе sound of your name (Oh)
(All your disgust, all your resentment)
Fall into your eyes like a grave
(All your differences, all your pain)
Bury me to the sound of your name
(All your pain)
All your pain (Oh)
(Fall into your eyes like a grave)
All your pain
(Bury me to the sound of your name, no)
All your pain
(Fall into your eyes like a grave, all your pain)
All your pain

[Outro]
(Do you like that? Do you like that? Do you like that? No)
(Do you like that? Do you like that? Do you like that? No)
(Do you like that? Do you like that? Do you like that? No)
(Do you like that? Do you like that? Do you like that? No)


5 The Love You Want 

[Verse 1]
You lie an inch apart on your own continuum
Now keep the freak show talk to a careful minimum
I'll find a different harbour to lay my anchor in
And you'll find a different way to keep from setting sail again, no

[Chorus]
But I'm still full of the love you want
Still waking up beneath it all
And I'm still full of the love you want
I reach for you on faith alone

[Verse 2]
Seems your heart is locked up and I still get the combination wrong
Or are you simply waiting to save your love for someone I am not?
Too many swallowed keys will make you bleed internally someday
Oh, oh
Maybe you believe that in the end, you will be better off that way
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And I'm still full of the love you want
Still waking up beneath it all
And I'm still full of the love you want
I reach for you on faith alone
And I'm still full of the love you want
Still waking up, so alone
And I'll be full of the love you want
No matter what, forevermore

[Bridge]
And I'm still full of the love you want
And I'm still full of the love you want
And I'm still full of the love you want
The love you want, the love you want
And I'm still full of the love you want
And I'm still full of the love you want
And I'm still full of the love you want
The love you want, the love you want

[Outro]
You lie an inch apart on your own continuum
Now keep the freak show talk to a careful minimum


6 Fall for Me 

[Verse 1]
In a city of ice, there are burning cathedrals
Turning the skies into glass
And through echoing futures are the buckling sutures
That hold shut the wounds of the past

[Chorus]
So won't you fall for me? Won't you fall for me?
Through a fractured existence, won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me, from reality?
To the rhythm of eternity, won't you fall for me?

[Verse 2]
My insecurities surround me like lions in the den
And I feel like I'm losing touch with what I am again
Slowly, I remember why I cannot pretend
That I never think of you in all this screaming silence
(Oh God, I wish you were here)

[Chorus]
So won't you fall for me? Won't you fall for me?
Through a fractured existence, won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me, from reality?
To the rhythm of eternity, won't you fall for me? (Oh God, I wish you were here)
Won't you fall for me? Won't you fall for me?
With my love as your garden, won't you fall for me?
Won't you fall for me, from reality?
I am yours in the end, so won't you fall for me?



7 Alkaline 

[Verse 1]
Every once in a while, something changes
And she's changing me
It's too late for me now, I am altered
There is something beneath

[Chorus]
She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The objects of my desire

[Verse 2]
Oh, let's talk about chemistry
'Cause I'm dying to melt through
To the hеart of her molecules
Till thе particles part like holy water
If anything, she's an undiscovered element
Either born in Hell or heaven-sent
Either way, I'm into it

[Chorus]
She's not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The objects of my desire
Not acid nor alkaline
Caught between black and white
Not quite either day or night
She's perfectly misaligned
I'm caught up in her design
And how it connects to mine
I see in a different light
The objects of my desire
8 Distraction 

[Verse 1]
Oh, and I know
I can tell I'm falling further, again
But I won't turn away, it's far too late for me

[Chorus]
'Cause I am broken into fractions
Oh, and I am driven to distraction

[Verse 2]
And I swear she is not like any other, no
Something more, more than I could ask for
(It's too late for me)

[Chorus]
'Cause I am broken into fractions
Oh, and I am driven to distraction, no
With each and every interaction
(It's too late for me)
(It's too late for me)
(It's too late for me)
(It's too late for me)
I am driven to distraction
(It's too late for me)
(It's too late for me)
(It's too late)

[Outro]
It's too late for me
It's too late for me
It's too late for me
It's too late for me
It's too late for me
It's too late for me
It's too late for me
It's too late


9 Descending 

[Verse 1]
Just take it all
For nothing again
Create, release
She just don't feel the same
I asked and you answered
But you eat your words in frame
At last, discover
You can't recall my name

[Pre-Chorus]
Until I let you fall away
I've been left no choice
Don't you see that?

[Chorus]
You come crawling back to me
But I'm already on the ground
And we all know that talk is cheap
So come on and save me now
And you wonder what I believe
But you don't wanna be around
So what would you do for me?
Yeah, what would you do for me?

[Verse 2]
I won't repeat
What I have said beforеhand
My love withers and chokes in pеrfect awe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
Till I let you fall away
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
I've been left no choice
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
Don't you see that?
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say?)

[Chorus]
You come crawling back to me
But I'm already on the ground
And we all know that talk is cheap
So come on and save me now
And you wonder what I believe
But you don't wanna be around
So what would you do for me?
Yeah, what would you do for me?

[Outro]
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
You come crawling back to me
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
But I'm already on the ground
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
And we all know that talk is cheap
So come on and save me now
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
And you wonder what I believe
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
But you don't wanna be around
(Why don't you just say what you wanted to say for once?)
So what would you do for me?
Yeah, what would you do for me?


10 Telomeres 

[Verse 1]
You guide me in
To safety and silence (Oh)
As you breathe me out
I drink you in (Oh)

[Chorus]
And we go beyond the farthest reaches
Where the light bends and wraps beneath us
And I know as you collapse into me
This is the start of something

[Verse 2]
Rivers and oceans
We could beckon, no
Your eyes and your limbs
Are instruments to pick apart
The distance within

[Bridge]
Let the tides carry you back to me
The past, the future
Through death
My arms are open

[Chorus]
We go beyond the farthest reaches
Where the light bends and wraps beneath us
And I know as you collapse into me
This is the start of something new

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental Outro]


11 High Water

[Verse 1]
For the time being
I will still avoid my own questions
And we both bury that history deep
But you know I can hold my breath forever
For the time being
You are still a perfect reminder of what
All of these scars on my arms are for
If I can hold myself together

[Chorus]
And I choke myself on sacred vapour
Waiting on some holy favour
Basking in the solace of regret
And it seems my hell is your high water
Wash me clean again before I pull myself beneath the waves

[Verse 2]
When thе mouth of infinity
Buries its teeth in me
I'll smile through thе agony for you
And I know you still bear the weight of your own existence
And you'll never bear the weight of two

[Chorus]
And I choke myself on sacred vapour
Waiting on some holy favour
Basking in the solace of regret
And it seems my hell is your high water
Wash me clean again before I pull myself beneath the waves

[Verse 3]
For the time being
I will admit my defeat again
I will accept that I can't pretend
We will ever be together

[Breakdown]
I can't hold myself together

[Instrumental Outro]

12 Missing Limbs 

[Verse 1]
Just let me know
If nowadays, the outer rounds of heaven don't
Keep up on the charm offensive anymore
Failing to remind you what you're living for
And I'd give anything to borrow your indifference
I'd drink you in
To temper your belief in all my promises
To swallow my desire and choke on it

[Chorus]
'Cause it still makes my blood run cold
To remember what they did before
The stories that you never told to me

[Verse 2]
Oh, bird, worry not
The blessings rain on battles in the heaven's arms
And my polite advances won't last for long
The eager apprehension is wearing off
I'd give anything
To balance your conviction with certainty
To fall asleep without you lying next to me
To sever my connection with everything

[Chorus]
'Cause it still makes my blood run cold
To remember what I did before
The stories that you never told to me
And it still makes my blood run thin
To remember what you are to him
And I live like I've got missing limbs for you



Take Me Back To Eden

1 Chokehold 

[Verse 1]
When we were made
It was no accident
We were tangled up like branches in a flood
I come as a blade
A sacred guardian
So you keep me sharp and test my worth in blood

[Chorus]
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a

[Verse 2]
Beneath the stormy seas
Above the mountain peaks
It's all the same to me
It makes no difference
I've seen my days unfold
Done the impossible
I'll turn my walls to gold to bring you home again
So show me that which I cannot see
Even if it hurts me
Even if I can't sleep
Oh, and though we act out of our holy duty to be constantly awake

[Chorus]
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold
You've got me in a chokehold

[Outro]
Even if it hurts me
Even if I can't sleep
Show me the way


2 The Summoning 


I've got a river running right into you
I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do
The taste of the divine

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got my body, flesh, and bone, yeah
The sky above, the Earth below

[Chorus]
Raise me up again
Take me past the edge
I want to see the other side
See the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got my body, flesh, and bone
The sky above, the Earth below

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Raise me up again
Takе me past the edgе
I want to see the other side
Won't you show me what it's like?
Won't you show me what it's like?

[Bridge]
Oh, and my love
Did I mistake you for a sign from God
Or are you really here to cast me off?
Or maybe just to turn me on
'Cause these days
I would be lying if I told you that
I didn't wish that I could be your man
Or maybe make a good girl bad

[Refrain]
I've got a river running right into you
I've got a blood trail, red in the blue
Something you say or something you do
The taste of the divine
You've got my body, flesh, and bone
The sky above, the Earth below
Nothing to say and nowhere to go
The taste of the divine


3 Granite

[Verse 1]
Sulfur on your breath
Granite in my chest
You won't ever have to talk about it
You'll never wanna talk about it
Fury too damn late
Reason dislocates
And you'll never have to talk about it
You'll never wanna talk about it

[Chorus]
I was more than just a body in your passenger seat
And you were more than just somebody I was destined to meet
I see you go half-blind when you're looking at me
But I am
Between the secondhand smoke and the glass on the street
You gave me nothing whatsoever but a reason to leave
You say you want mе, but you know I'm not what you need
But I am

[Verse 2]
When you'd sit there acting likе you know me
Acting like you only brought me here to get below me
Never mind the death threats, parting at the door
We'd rather be six feet under than be lonely
And if you had a problem, then you should have told me
'Fore you started getting all aggressive and controlling
You only drink the water when you think it's holy
So keep an eye on the road or we will both be here forever

[Chorus]
I was more than just a body in your passenger seat
And you were more than just somebody I was destined to meet
I see you go half-blind when you're looking at me
But I am
Between the secondhand smoke and the glass on the street
You gave me nothing whatsoever but a reason to leave
You say you want me, but you know I'm not what you need
But I am

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I was more than just a body in your passenger seat
And you were more than just somebody I was destined to meet
I see you go half-blind when you're looking at me
But I am
Between the second-hand smoke and the glass on the street
You gave me nothing whatsoever but a reason to leave
You say you want me, but you know I'm not what you need
But I am


4 Aqua Regia 

[Verse 1]
Well, my love is an animal call
Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls
Between teeth on a broken jaw
Following a blood trail, frothing at the maw
These days I'm a circuit board
Integrated hardware you cannot afford
The perfect start to a perfect war
Putting down the roses picking up the sword

[Refrain]
Aqua regia
Aqua regia

[Verse 2]
Well, my past is a holy book
A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook
Between the pain and the way you look
I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook
And these days I'm a picture frame
Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain
Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain
All of Eden's vices running through my veins

[Chorus]
Aqua regia
Oxytocin running in the ether
Silicon ballrooms
Subatomic interactions if it's all good
Gold rush, acid flux
Saturate me, I can't get enough
Cold love, hot blood
Running to your heart when you're thinking of

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Oh, when I am done dancing to alarm bells
No wonder my ears are still ringing
And I am done fighting off change
No wonder my arms are still swinging

[Chorus]
Aqua regia
Oxytocin running in the ether
Silicon ballrooms
Subatomic interactions if it's all good
Gold rush, acid flux
Saturate me, I can't get enough
Cold love, hot blood
Running to your heart when you're thinking of


5 Vore 

[Verse 1]
You have become the voice in my head
Only recourse we're left after death
Your viscera welcome me in
Welcome me in
My life is torn, my bones, they bleed
My metaphors fall short in the end
Your flesh and bone welcome me in
Welcome me in
(Are you in pain like I am?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Will we remain stuck in the throat of gods?
Will the pain stop if we go deeper?

[Chorus]
So lеt's get swallowed whole
I wanna go whеre nobody else will
Ever go

[Verse 2]
Walls of flesh, so warm again
We step into my suffering
My only need
Welcome me in
Welcome me in

[Refrain]
There is always something in the way
I wanna have you to myself for once
Follow me between the jaws of fate
So I can have you to myself for once

[Chorus]
So let's get swallowed whole
I wanna go where nobody else will
Ever go

[Refrain]
There is always something in the way
I wanna have you to myself for once

[Outro]
Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?
Are you in pain like I am?


6 Ascensionism 

[Intro]
Well, I know what you want from me
You want someone to be
Your reflection, your bitter deception
Setting you free
So you take what you want and leave

[Verse 1]
Who made you like this?
Who encrypted your dark gospel in body language?
Synapses snap back in blissful anguish
Tell me you met me in past lives, past life
Past what might be eating me from the inside, darling
Half algorithm, half deity
Glitches in the code or gaps in a strange dream
Tell me you guessed my future and it mapped onto your fantasy
Turn me into your mannequin and I'll turn you into my puppet queen

[Verse 2]
Won't you come and dance in the dark with me?
Show me what you are, I am desperate to know
Nobody better than the perfect enemy
Digital demons make the night feel heavenly
Make it real
'Cause anything's better than the way I feel right now
I can offer you a blacklit paradise
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky

[Verse 3]
Lipstick, chemtrails, red flags, pink nails, with
One eye on the door, other eye on a rail
Other other eye following a scarlet trail
And the last few drops from the Holy Grail, now
Rose gold chains, ripped lace, cut glass
Blood stains on the collar means just don't ask
Be the first to the feast
Let's choke on the past and
Take to the broken skies at last

[Bridge]
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
(Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky)
Diamonds in the trees, pentagrams in the night sky

[Breakdown]
You're gonna watch me ascend

[Verse 4]
And I know what you want from me
You want the same as me
My redemption, eternal ascension
Setting me free
So I'll take what I want then leave

[Outro]
You make me wish I could disappear, no
You make me wish I could disappear


7 Are You Really Okay? 

[Verse 1]
I raised you in the dark
Caught you reading by the sunrise
You wandered from the path
Through the silence of the hillside

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And don't you know
I could see it in you even then?
And don't you know
I was trying to hold back the darkness?

[Chorus]
And are you really okay?
Are you really okay?

[Verse 2]
You woke me up one night
Dripping crimson on the carpet
I saw it in your eyes
Cutting deeper than the scars could run

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And don't you know
I can see it in you even now?
And don't you know?
I want to help you but I don't know how

[Chorus]
And are you really okay? Yeah, yeah
Are you really okay?

[Bridge]
And I
I cannot fix your wounds this time
But I
I don't beliеve you when you tell mе you are fine

[Outro]
Please don't hurt yourself again
Just please don't hurt yourself again, no
Please don't hurt yourself again
Please don't hurt yourself again


8 The Apparition 

[Intro]
Why are you never real?
Whenever you appear
You leave me with that grace
I am trembling with fear
But I know that you will disappear
Just as I awake
Whisper in my ear

[Chorus]
Well, I believe
Somewhere in the past
Something was between
You and I, my dear
And it remains
With me to this day
No matter what I do
This scar will never fade

[Refrain]
So let's make trouble in the dream world
Hijack Heaven with another memory now
I make the most of the turning tide
It just split what's left of the burning silence
Don't wait, 'cause this could be the last time
You turn up in the reveries of my mind
I wake up to a suicide frenzy
Loaded dreams still leave me empty

[Chorus]
And I believe
That somewhere in the past
Something was between
You and I, my dear
And it remains
With me to this day
No matter what I do
This wound will never heal

[Bridge]
Why are you never real?
The shifting states you follow me through
Unrevealed
Just let me go or take me with you

[Refrain]
So let's make trouble in the dream world
Hijack Heaven with another memory now
I make the most of the turning tide
It just split what's left of the burning silence
Don't wait, 'cause this could be the last time
You turn up in the reveries of my mind
I wake up to a suicide frenzy
Loaded dreams still leave me empty


9 DYWTYLM 

[Verse 1]
Do you roll with the waves?
Or do you duck into deep blue safety?
Is it always the same?

[Refrain]
Do you wish that you loved me?

[Verse 2]
Do you pull at the chains?
Or do you push into constant aching?
Each and every day

[Refrain]
Do you wish that you loved me?

[Verse 3]
Is there something you give
That you will never receive in return?
Do you know what it is?

[Refrain]
Do you wish that you loved me?

[Verse 4]
Are you trying to live
Like everything is a lesson to learn?
Can you ever forgive? (Yourself)

[Refrain]
Do you wish that you loved me?

[Bridge]
And my reflection just won't smile back at me likе I know it should
And I would turn into a stranger in an instant if I could
And there is somеthing eating me alive, I don’t know what it is
Maybe not that you conceal your feelings, they just don't exist

[Verse 5]
Do you ever believe
That we can turn into different people?
It's getting harder to be (Myself)

[Refrain]
Do you wish that you loved me?

[Verse 6]
Can we ever release?
Is it better to just not feel?
Can we hit delete?

[Refrain]
Do you wish that you loved me?

[Bridge]
It’s been so long that I'm forgetting what it feels like
But I'd rather not remind myself and leave it all behind
And I've tried so hard to fix it all but nothing seems to help
But I cannot hope to give you what I cannot give myself

[Outro]
Do you wish that you loved me? (Smile back)
Do you wish that you loved me? (At me)
Do you wish that you loved me? Oh-woah
Do you wish that you loved me? (Please)
Do you wish that you loved me? (Smile back)
Do you wish that you loved me? (At me)
Do you wish that you loved me? Oh-woah
Do you wish that you loved me?


10 Rain 

[Verse 1]
For so long, I have waited
So long that I almost became
Just a stoic statue, fit for nobody
And I don't wanna get in your way
But I finally think I can say
That the vicious cycle was over
The moment you smiled at me

[Chorus]
And just like the rain
You cast the dust into nothing
And wash out the salt from my hands
So touch me again
I feel my shadow dissolving
Will you cleanse me with pleasure?

[Verse 2]
It's that chemical cut that I can get down with
Up like the moon and out like the hounds
A dangerous disposition somehow
Refracted in light, reflected in sound
I'm coiled up like the venomous serpent
Tangled in your trance and I'm certain
You have got your hooks in me
And I know, I know the way that it goes
You get what you give, you reap what you sow
And I can see you in my fate
And I know, I know I am what I am
The mouth of the wolf, the eyes of the lamb
So darling, will you saturate?

[Chorus]
And just like the rain
You cast the dust into nothing
And wash out the salt from my hands
So touch me again
I feel my shadow dissolving
Will you cleanse me with pleasure?

[Bridge]
Nobody can say for certain
If maybe it's all just a game
When I open my eyes to the future
I can hear you say my name

[Outro]
So rain down on me, oh, oh-oh-oh
Rain down on me, oh-oh-oh
Rain down on me, oh, oh-oh-oh
Rain down on me
Rain down on me, yeah
Rain down on me, oh, oh-oh-oh
Rain down on me, oh-oh-oh
Rain down on me, oh, oh-oh-oh
Rain down on me
Rain down on me, yeah
Rain down on me


11 Take Me Back to Eden 

[Verse 1]
I dream in phosphorescence
Bleed through spaces
See you drifting past the fog
But no one told you where to go
We dive through crystal waters
Perfect oceans
But no one told me not to breathe
And now the weightlessness recedes

[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and thе gods grow tired
Reset my patiеnt violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

[Refrain]
I will travel far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden

[Verse 2]
Well, yeah, I spit blood when I wake up
Sink porcelain stained, choking up brain matter and make-up
Just two days since the mainframe went down and I'm still messed up
Room feels like a meat freezer I dangle in like cold cuts
Missed calls, answer phones from people I just don't trust
Mirror talk, fake love
But I'll take a pound of your flesh before you take a piece of my paystub
White roses, black doves
Godmother, rise up
I need you to see me for what I have become

[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

[Verse 3]
I guess it goes to show, does it not?
That we've no idea what we've got
Until we lose it (Until we lose it, until we lose it)
And no amount of love will keep it around
If we don't choose it (Choose it)
And I don't know what's got its teeth in me
But I'm about to bite back in anger
No amount of self-sought fury
Will bring back the glory of innocence

[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire

[Post-Chorus]
When we were made, I know
It was no accident
You know my desire
We were tangled up like branches in a flood

[Refrain]
I have traveled far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden


12 Euclid 

[Verse 1]
Just run it back, give me five whole minutes, I am
Thick tar on the inside burning
I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning and a
Heavy head that won't stop turning
If my fate is a bad collision, and if
My mind is an open highway
Give me the twilight two-way vision
Give me one last ride on a sunset sky lane

[Refrain]
Call me when you get the chance
I can feel the walls around me closing in

[Verse 2]
Just running forwards, a life like wires as I
See the past on an empty ceiling
I play along with the life signs anyway but
Hope to God you don't know this feeling
Yet in reverse you are all my symmetry
A parallel I would lay my life on
So if your wings won't find you heaven
I will bring it down like an ancient bygone

[Refrain]
Call me when you have the time
I just need to leave this part of me behind

[Verse 3]
Do you remember me
When the rain gathers?
And do you still believe
That nothing else matters?
For me
It's still the autumn leaves
These ancient canopies
That we used to lay beneath
No, by now
The night belongs to you
This bough has broken through
I must be someone new

[Bridge]
No, for me (Just run it back, give me five whole minutes, I am)
(Thick tar on the inside burning) It's still the autumn leaves
(I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning and a)
(Heavy head that won't stop turning) These ancient canopies
(If my fate is a bad collision and)
(If my mind is an open highway) We used to lay beneath
(Give me the twilight two-way vision)
(Give me one last ride on a sunset sky lane) No, by now
(Just running forwards, a life like wires as I)
(See the past on an empty ceiling) The night belongs to you
(I play along with the life signs anyway but)
(Hope to God you don't know this feeling) This bough has broken through
(Yet in reverse you are all my symmetry)
(A parallel I would lay my life on) I must be someone new
(So if your wings won't find you heaven)
(I will bring it down like an ancient bygone)

[Outro]
The whites of your eyes
Turn black in the lowlight
In turning divine
We tangle endlessly
Like lovers entwined
I know for the last time
You will not be mine
So give me the night, the night, the night
